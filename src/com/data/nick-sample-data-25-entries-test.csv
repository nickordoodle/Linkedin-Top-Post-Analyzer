1"As I start to pursue my interest in #flutterappdevelopment I am learning what it is best used for. In my opinion based on my knowledge so far -> it is an ideal mobile development solution for small to medium sized businesses. Takes MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to the next level. A few points.. Pros: - a cross platform mobile solution ie. one codebase for Android and iOS (yuck) using Dart language - very easy and quick to demo using hot reloads - overall fast development - removes dependency nightmare (thinking of Android development for this point) Cons: - lack of native support requires custom plugins to integrate many native features - apps are very large even to start - flutter and the  language are still fairly new "#dart #mobiledevelopment #minimumviableproduct #crossplatformdevelopment31
