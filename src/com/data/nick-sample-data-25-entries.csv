1,"As I start to pursue my interest in #flutterappdevelopment, I am learning what it is best used for. In my opinion based on my knowledge so far -> it is an ideal mobile development solution for small to medium sized businesses. Takes MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to the next level. A few points.. Pros: - a cross platform mobile solution, ie. one codebase for Android and iOS (yuck) using Dart language - very easy and quick to demo using hot reloads - overall fast development - removes dependency nightmare (thinking of Android development for this point) Cons: - lack of native support, requires custom plugins to integrate many native features - apps are very large, even to start - flutter and the  language are still fairly new ",#dart #mobiledevelopment #minimumviableproduct #crossplatformdevelopment,3,1,421
2,"What type of content are you posting, sharing and engaging with? And during what timeframe(s)? A while back, Todd Scarborough and I held a conversation and something he said stuck with me. There are two general categories of posts and content. They are ""Ask"" and ""Give"". I find that this thinking framework dramatically simplifies your ""thought power"" of what to post. And in general, it is ideal if you post a ""Give"" more often than an ""Ask"". Lastly, this image covers ideal timeframes of when to post your content in order to maximize its potential.

3,"Do you want to hear my success story so far? As promised, here is the article that I wrote. Transitioning out of the military and aligning yourself on a new path is not easy... but it is possible. Moreover, it is completely doable if you take the time and steps to prepare. I am sharing a glimpse of my story in the hopes that I can help at least one person out there! And I always like to hear other people's stories as well :) ",#military #transitioningmilitary #softwareengineering,24,21,89
4,"When was a time that you overcame ? It's inevitable that we all will face adverse conditions at sometime in our lives. I think it is important to reflect upon those times of how or why you succeeded when the odds were against you. Here's Mine.. May 14, 2017 - Graduated College May 16, 2017 - Commissioned into the Army May 17, 2017 - Second Knee Surgery on the same Knee May 29, 2017 - Run 5 miles on my first day of work, Fort Benning, GA, Infantry Officer Course The amount of stress and anxiety I faced of not only starting my first professional employment experience but ALSO not knowing if I would make it was into the sky. Would I be kicked out? Would I further damage my knee? Would they change my school date to a later time? I trusted my gut and made it out okay. My desire to succeed was far greater than mitigating risk in this situation. And that I did. Sometimes you just have to ""Send it!"" I want to hear your stories, whatever the context was!

5,"Sometimes your thought process is the only thing stopping you from doing great things. I am actively doing my best to change the way I perceive situations and make decisions. Here's a scenario: ""This new appealing feature will be impossible to create"" -Thought ""Yeah, it seems difficult, I'll work on other things"" -Old Me ""Why is it 'impossible'? What are the biggest challenges presented by this feature? Do I need to access outside help or resources? "" -New Me ""It will be a steep learning curve"" -Thought ""Looks like it is time to modify my schedule and set aside study/research time to get this feature going! (Note to self, it probably won't be easy like most things in life but I can do it). -New Me Consistently practicing mindfulness and living with a contagiously positive attitude will take you wherever you want to go.

6,"Veterans are entitled to FREE mental health services up to one year after separation. In light of the continuing global pandemic and the rise of mental health issues, I want to make sure that transitioning servicemembers and recently separated veterans know about this information. They can also refill empty prescriptions. Verbatim from the VA: ""Get free mental health care for a year after separation—no matter your discharge status, service history, or eligibility for VA health care.""

7,Just had a great conversation with Tony Kipkemboi . He is a servicemember transitioning in about a year or so that is looking into technical job opportunities. Tony and I discussed some of the software development opportunities available. He is pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science which shows his commitment to formal education as well as his desire to enter some type of software engineering position in the future. I recommend you network with Tony if you are a recruiter or person with a technology background! ,#softwaredevelopment #militarytransition #employment #dodskillbridge #vetshelpingvets,20,5,1878
8,"Easy Productivity Tip: Quickly switch between windows and applications. Windows Users: Press and hold ALT. Click TAB while holding ALT to cycle through windows/apps. Mac Users: Press and Hold COMMAND. Click TAB while holding COMMAND to cycle through windows/apps. When the next window you want to go to is highlighted, simply LET GO of ALT/COMMAND. This will take you to that selected window. This is especially useful when working between two applications that both require the entire screen.

I knew years later when I would break into a technology career, I would face difficulties since I lacked internships and tech experience. I started and spent the majority of my transition in Korea, faced the COVID job market and challenges, struggled with depression at times, participated in weekly virtual job fairs, learned an immense amount of knowledge from prominent leaders across industries, excelled in a remote internship and networked/interviewed a ton!

17,"Lesson Learned Tuesdays... Not all companies and organizations are created equal. I was interviewing for a company about a week ago and passed the initial screening along with assessments. I was confident I would land the position. But LISTEN TO THIS...Terms of the position 1) They would fabricate my resume and add 5 years of Android development experience that would be sent to their clients while only going through a 7 week training program. 2) They charge their clients about $150-300 an hour but pay employees about $27-33. I am not a mathematician but this tells me they don't invest in their employees. 3) They change their company name approx. every year due to fraud and company reviews. Although I am still #opentowork, I could never see my morals and values align with this organization. I had to respectfully decline. I'd like to hear what others think about this.

19,"Do you know about #flutterdev yet?! It is an open source mobile framework for UI development created by Google. Using the #dart language, you can use one codebase to version both #android and #ios apps. I am excited to see the capabilities flutter has to offer. In the screenshot, you can see #vscode, an ios simulator, an android emulator and a terminal running the demo app. Hot reloads will update both simulators at the same time. Pretty incredible! I am running about 12/16gb RAM right now. Make sure your computer specs can support. You can also run just one virtual device at a time.

23,"I felt compelled to create a video of the best times my Soldiers and I had during my Army service. I used Adobe Premiere Pro and footage from multiple media sources whether it was a low quality phone, the newest iPhone on the market, a GoPro and so on. I have never used Premiere Pro before so it was exciting to see an end product. Adobe apps are officially my newest hobbies. One challenge I faced was to constantly fill a 1080p screen for Youtube using phone/ low quality videos. My solution to this as shown was to combine various clips into the same frame/scene. If you know anyone that needs to create a video of any nature at this moment, please feel free to refer me or message me :) ",#alwayslearning #premierepro #adobecreativecloud #military #militaryveterans,9,0,636

25,"I have recently completed my Hiring Our Heroes fellowship at Novetta as a Cyber Security Engineer ! A few things happened during this time: 1) I confirmed my aspiration and desire to enter a technical field after my military transition, either as a Software Engineer or a Cyber Security Engineer. 2) I faced many new technical problems that I was eager to solve. Some of these problems were: learning a new language (Python - took about 4-5 days to become comfortable), developing networking/TCP/socket programming code, creating a testing framework and black box testing client-server models. 3) I started to see differences in corporate culture versus the norms that the military instills in us. 4) I learned how software development and project flow can be run when you have multiple team members, features, branches etc. being developed at the same time. 5) I reminded myself that one of the most important aspects of an organization is the people that are in it. Even in a remote environment, I was able to establish meaningful relationships in the workplace.
